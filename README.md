# ADC-frontend

### Conventions

-   Create files with .jsx extension.
-   Let's name our files using Pascal case i.e SignUp.jsx, TheNameOfFIle.jsx.

### Directory structure

-   assets/
    -   Will store images and static stuff that is not code.
-   components/
    -   Will store React components like buttons, textfields etc. which we will be importing.
-   screens/
    -   Will store the pages in the system like Login.jsx, Signup.jsx, Dashboard.jsx.
-   util/
    -   Will store core pieces of code, that don't fit in the other directories.

### Tailwind instructions

-   Use the class `font-heading` to use Open Sans font which we agreed is for headings.
-   use the class `bg-primary`(for background) or `text-primary`(for text), `border-primary`(for border) for the primary navy blue color.
-   For the `danger` color we use `bg-red-500`, `text-red-500`, `border-red-500`.
-   For gray font color let's use `text-gray-600`

### App Context

In order that we have a central store of the state of the application we use React Context. To use it...

#### Accessing the context

1.  Import `useContext` into your file, like:

    `import React, { useContext } from "react";`

2.  Import our context too, like this:

    `import { AppContext } from "./util/AppContext";`

3.  Use the context
    Destructure the context item you want to use

    `const { user } = useContext(AppContext);`

    Use or mutate the context data.
